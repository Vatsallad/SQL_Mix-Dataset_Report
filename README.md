# SQL_Mix-Dataset_Report

  To analyze various datasets (FIFA19 player data, digital media store records and Netflix data) for insightful findings through thorough data cleaning, segmentation, and utilization of SQL functions and joins.

* Datasets Reviewed:

- FIFA19 Player Data
- Digital Media Store Records
- Netflix Data

* Data Cleaning:

- Conducted an initial review of all datasets to understand the structure and contents.
- Performed data cleaning to rectify inconsistencies and ensure data accuracy and reliability.

* Specific Questions Addressed:
  
- Segmented datasets to focus on specific analysis questions.
- Utilized diverse SQL functions to extract meaningful insights.

* SQL Functions Employed:
  
- COUNT: To count the number of records meeting specific criteria.
- SUM: To calculate the total sum of numeric columns.
- AVG: To find the average value of numeric columns.
- ROUND: To round numerical results to a specified number of decimal places.
- DISTINCT: To retrieve unique values from a column.
- GROUP BY: To aggregate data based on one or more columns.
- ORDER BY: To sort the results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
- MAX: To find the maximum value in a column.
- MIN: To find the minimum value in a column.
- LIKE: To filter results based on pattern matching.
- WHERE: To specify conditions for data filtering.
- AS: To rename columns or expressions for better readability.
- AND: To combine multiple conditions in queries.
- ON: To specify join conditions.

* Data Integration:

 Joins Utilized:
 - LEFT JOIN: To combine records from multiple tables, including all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
 - INNER JOIN: To combine records from multiple tables, including only matching records from both tables.
   Sorting and Result Set Restriction:

* Sorting:

- Applied ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending) sorting to organize results effectively.

* Result Set Restriction:
  
- Utilized LIMIT to restrict the number of records returned for efficient analysis.

* Conclusion:
  Through the application of data cleaning, segmentation, and advanced SQL functions, significant insights were derived from the FIFA19 player data, digital media store records, and Netflix data. The use of various SQL functions, joins, sorting, and result set restrictions facilitated efficient and effective data analysis.
